## Briefs for each stage

### 游댮 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 游리 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 游릭 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 游댯 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 游릮 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

Welcome to this hypothetical little universe which follows a hypothetical sequence of hypothetical seasons.

I am really interested in the naturally occuring types of time - and how we tend to forget about this mesasurment of time in the overbearing presence of the man-made clock. I like the idea that the natural world around us time keeps in a very different way, following and changing with the path of the sun in a perpertual and fairly predictable loop. I wanted to create a hypothetical natural loop that follows similar seasonal cycles to Earth, but on a smaller scale. There are 26 images in the changing cycle which each represent about 14 days passing. the loop cycles through 365 days worth of seasonal changes in 26 seconds.

To create the first image I began by asking generative AI to process one single "summer" landscape. I wanted it to be as broad a promt as possible so that there would be some room for the AI to essentially make choices about what it wanted to present. Then I went into photoshop with the image and continiued to apply new generative fill overtop of each new image and add prompts to areas such as "winter snowstorm sky" "dry barren desert" "spring flowers" "wetlands" etc. It took some time to blend each new image into the next so it didn't look to jarring. I wanted the flow of time to have some logic to it which is why it roughly follows Earth's seasonal changes.
